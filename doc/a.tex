\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
	We present a simple and fast multi-scale blob detector.
	The ``blobs'' are defined as well-contrasted local maxima or minima of
	the image with a round shape.
	It is a straightforward differential criterion based on the Hessian
	matrix of the image filtered at different scales, requiring about 18
	multiplications per pixel.
	The criteria for the proposed implementation are, in decreasing order
	of importance: (1) simplicity of the algorithm, (2) minimal
	computational cost, (3) quality of the result.
	We believe that our implementation is the shortest possible code that
	is able to detect white and black blobs of any size in images.

\section{Introduction}

Blob detection is the task of finding round and well-contrasted objects in an
image.  See Figure~\ref{fig:blobsandnot} for examples of blobs and non-blobs.
Notice that are two kinds of blobs: dark blobs on a light background and light
blobs on a dark background.  In this article we focus only on the first kind
(dark blobs); the case of light blobs is be obtained by applying the same
algorithm to the negative image.

one paragrah with short history of feature detection: edges, points, etc

one paragraph about keypoint detection: corners vs. local extrema vs. centers
of blobs

Let us model our image as a smooth function~$u:\R^2\to\R$.
We use the following criteria for detecting (dark) blobs 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The position of a blob is a local minimum of the image~$u$
	\item These neighboring points are significantly lighter than the center
	\item The level lines around the blob are approximately circular
	\item Blobs may occur at any scale
\end{enumerate}

criterion in the continuous domain:

1) local minima of the $\sigma$-filtered image

2) such that $u_{xx}+u_{yy} > \tau$ and
$\frac{u_{xx}u_{yy}-u_{xy}^2}{(u_{xx}+u_{yy})^2}>\kappa$
